# Multimodal Fusion Design

## Overview

The system implements **decision-level multimodal fusion**, combining structured outputs from voice and gesture modalities into a single unified robot command.

Unlike early fusion approaches that operate on raw sensor data, this system performs fusion at the **semantic level**, merging command fields that have been interpreted already:

- `action`
- `object`
- `location`

The fusion process integrates:
- Temporal alignment
- Confidence-based decision making
- Conflict resolution
- Missing field recovery

## Fusion Inputs

Each modality produces a partial `RobotCommand`:

### Voice Input
- Extracted from natural language
- Provides: `action`, `object`, `location`
- Includes per-field confidence scores

### Gesture Input
- Derived from hand pose and spatial position
- Provides:
  - `action` (gesture classification)
  - `location` (left/right inference)
- Includes confidence scores for gesture and location

These inputs are fused into a single command using the algorithm described below.

## Temporal Alignment

Fusion is gated by a temporal constraint to ensure inputs are related.

- A maximum window of **3 seconds** is used: `FUSION_WINDOW_SECONDS = 3.0`

The temporal score is defined as:

$$
\text{score} = 1 - \left(\frac{\text{gap}}{\text{window}}\right)^{\alpha}
$$

Where:
- $\text{gap}$ is the time difference between voice and gesture inputs
- $\text{window}$ is the maximum fusion window
- $\alpha$ is the temporal decay exponent

If $\text{gap} > \text{window}$,  fusion is rejected .

Otherwise, the temporal score is used to scale the final confidence.


## Field-Level Fusion

Each field (`action`, `object`, `location`) is processed independently.

### Case 1: Single-Modality Contribution

If only one modality provides a value:

- Accept if confidence exceeds threshold:
  - Voice: `>= 0.4`
  - Gesture:
    - Action: `>= 0.5`
    - Location: `>= 0.5`

Otherwise, field is discarded.

---

### Case 2: Agreement

If both modalities agree:

- Value is accepted
- Confidence is taken as: $\max(\text{voice}, \text{gesture})$
- Marked as `"agreement"`

Agreement contributes positively to final confidence through the agreement bonus.

---

### Case 3: Conflict Resolution

If modalities disagree:

- Compare confidence scores
- Apply **voice bias margin**:
    ```
    if voice_conf >= gesture_conf - margin:
        choose voice
    else:
        choose gesture
    ```
    Where: `FUSION_VOICE_BIAS_MARGIN = 0.15`

This reflects the assumption that:
- Voice is generally more precise for semantics
- Gesture provides spatial context

---

### Ambiguity Detection

If confidence gap is small: 

$$
|\text{voice}_{conf} - \text{gesture}_{conf}| < 0.15
$$

Then the result is flagged as **ambiguous** and may require confirmation.

---

## Handling Missing Information

Fusion supports **complementary input**:

- Voice may omit location
- Gesture provides location
- Combined result becomes complete

If fields remain missing:
- Penalty is applied to final confidence


## Confidence Computation

Final confidence is computed as:

$$
\text{confidence} =
(\text{base} + \text{adjustments}) \times \text{temporal score}
$$

### Base Confidence
Average of merged field confidences.

### Adjustments
- Agreement bonus: `+0.1` per agreeing field
- Conflict penalty: `-0.1` per conflict
- Missing penalty: `-0.05` per missing field

### Temporal Scaling
The temporal score reduces confidence when the two modalities are less well aligned in time.

The final result is clamped to: `[0.0, 1.0]`.

## Fusion Output

The fusion process produces a `FusionResult` containing:

- Final `RobotCommand`
- Field-level provenance (voice / gesture / agreement)
- Conflict fields
- Temporal metadata
- Confidence decision reasoning
- Ambiguity flags

This supports both:
- Real-time feedback
- Detailed post-hoc analysis


## Worked Example 1:  Complementary Fusion

### Input

#### Voice:
```
"pick up the red cube"
-> action = pick (0.85)
-> object = red_cube (0.80)
-> location = None
```

#### Gesture:
```
hand positioned left
-> location = left (0.75)
```

### Fusion
- Temporal alignment is within the fusion window
- No conflicts between modalities
- The missing `location` field is filled using gesture input
- All fields meet their respective confidence thresholds

### Output
```
action = pick
object = red_cube
location = left
confidence = high
```

The final confidence in this case is high due to:
- strong voice confidence for action and object
- successful completion of missing fields via gesture
- absence of conflicts or penalties
- temporal alignment within the fusion window

## Worked Example 2: Conflict and Ambiguity

### Input

#### Voice:
```
"place the red cube on the left"
-> action = place (0.78)
-> object = red_cube (0.82)
-> location = left (0.60)
```

#### Gesture:
```
hand positioned right
-> location = right (0.65)
```

### Fusion

- Temporal alignment is within the fusion window
- Conflict detected in `location` field:
  - voice = left (0.60)
  - gesture = right (0.65)

- Confidence comparison:
  - gesture confidence exceeds voice confidence beyond the bias margin

- Therefore, gesture overrides voice for the `location` field

- Confidence gap is small:
$$
|\text{voice}_{conf} - \text{gesture}_{conf}| < 0.15
$$

- Result is flagged as **ambiguous**

### Output
```
action = place
object = red_cube
location = right
confidence = medium
```

The final confidence is reduced due to:
- conflict penalty
- small confidence gap (ambiguity)
